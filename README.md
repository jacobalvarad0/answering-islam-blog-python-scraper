## Answering Islam Blog Python Scraper

This is just a simple script, for scraping Sam Shamoun's [Answering Islam](https://answeringislamblog.wordpress.com/) Blog.

This turns the blog posts in .md files so you can use in Obsidian. 

Maybe in the future I will edit the script to link the links at the bottom, so it will be more seemless with Obsidian.
